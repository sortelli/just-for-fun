# The 7th Guest & The 11th Hour

This is a collection of solutions to puzzles from the old video
games The 7th Guest, and The 11th Hour.

All the puzzles from these games are actually really stupid, because
all of them are solvable through brute force guessing.  In fact,
most of the puzzles can only be solved by guessing, which isn't
very fun.  A more fun way to play the games is to write code to
generate the solutions.
